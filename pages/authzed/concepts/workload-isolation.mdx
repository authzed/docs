# Workload Isolation

Workload Isolation is functionality exclusive to AuthZed products by which we give your SpiceDB deployments access to hardware that is only used by you, to guarantee performance and prevent "noisy neighbor" problems.

## Control Plane

Services that are secondary to serving real-time requests run one shared workload called the control plane.

These services include:

- AuthZed management UI and its accompanying machinery
- Observability services for the SRE team (e.g. Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger)
- Compliance infrastructure

## Low-latency Workloads on Kubernetes

AuthZed has presented a video to the [CNCF] documenting some of the critical components to running low-latency workloads on Kubernetes.
The technologies presented partially describe the implementation of Workload Isolation in AuthZed products:
