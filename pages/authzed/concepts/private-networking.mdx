# Private Networking

Private Networking is functionality exclusive to AuthZed Dedicated that restricts network access to internal networks.
When enabled, connections that are not configured are rejected.

By adding this additional layer of security, entire classes of security risk are eliminated because only trusted networks have access to the software powering your authorization systems.

In the scenario you choose not to use Private Networking, AuthZed Dedicated can alternatively be configured for access over the open internet.
