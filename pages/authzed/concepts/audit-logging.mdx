# Audit Logging

Audit Logging is functionality exclusive to AuthZed products that publishes logs of SpiceDB API operations to a log sink.

## Log Format

Logs contain the full details related to a request including:

- API Token hash
- Request Method
- Request Body
- Request IP
- Response Body
- Errors (if any)

### Example

```json
{
  "specversion": "1.0",
  "id": "35cdd6662882bd387292ef78a650d18b",
  "source": "/ps/dev-ps/rc/us-east-1/p/dev-ps-abcd1234",

      "schemaText": "definition folder {\n\trelation reader: user | service\n\tpermission read = reader\n}\n\ndefinition resource {\n\trelation reader: user | service\n\tpermission read = reader\n}\n\ndefinition service {}\n\ndefinition user {}",
      "readAt": {

## Log Sinks

Log Sinks are the targets where logs will be shipped in order to be persisted.

### AWS Kinesis and Kinesis Firehose

As a prerequisite to use [Kinesis] or [Kinesis Firehose] as a log sink, an IAM role must exist in the AWS account
with the necessary permissions to write to the Kinesis stream or Firehose delivery stream.

This is an example policy that grants the necessary permissions to write to a Firehose delivery stream:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "firehose:PutRecord"
            ],
            "Resource": "EXAMPLE_FIREHOSE_ARN"
        }
    ]
} 
```

[Kinesis]: https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis
[Kinesis Firehose]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/what-is-this-service.html

#### Dedicated

For Dedicated customers, this role will also need a trust policy which allows the role to be assumed by the AuthZed account
in order to deliver logs to the stream.

To find the Dedicated AWS account ID, navigate to the Permission System's settings page, find the Audit Log settings,
and choose "AWS Kinesis" or "AWS Kinesis Firehose" as the log sink.
The account ID will be displayed in the configuration.

This is an example trust policy that allows the AuthZed account to assume the role:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "EXAMPLE_AUTHZED_ACCOUNT_ID"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "sts:ExternalId": "EXAMPLE_EXTERNAL_ID"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

## Configuration

The process for setting up audit logging varies depending on the AuthZed product you're using.
Find the instructions for your product below.

### Dedicated

Using the web dashboard, navigate to the Permission System's settings page to find the Audit Log settings.

### Self-Hosted

Audit logging is configured using command-line flags.
