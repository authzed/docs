# Management Dashboard

The Management Dashboard is a web-based application for organizations to manage SpiceDB deployments.
The dashboard is primarily targeting platform operators that want to configure and monitor the service.

The Management Dashboard is exclusive to AuthZed [Dedicated], [Cloud], and [Serverless].
In order to support a wider variety of environments, [Enterprise] customers configure [Extenders] directly instead of the Management Dashboard.
