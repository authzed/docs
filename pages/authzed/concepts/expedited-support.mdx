## Free Plans

### Basic Support

Not everyone is a paying customer and that's okay.
In this case, AuthZed will do their best to support you or point you in the right direction for getting what you need to be successful.

This support is done through [support.authzed.com][support] or [support@authzed.com][email].

### Community Support

Community support is available to absolutely everyone and does not require any form of payment or usage of Authzed products.

[Discord] is the first line of support for asking questions or getting help with SpiceDB.

For bug reports, feature requests, or questions [GitHub issues] is also available.

While AuthZed's products are proprietary, the foundation of these products will always be open source.
Many folks participating in these open source communities are AuthZed customers or employees that have relevant experience to help out.
