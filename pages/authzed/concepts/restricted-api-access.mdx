# Restricted API Access

Restricted API Access is functionality exclusive to AuthZed products that restricts access to SpiceDB for API Tokens.

This functionality enables organizations to apply the principle of least-privilege to services accessing SpiceDB.
For example, read-only tokens can be created for services that should never need to write to SpiceDB.

Those familiar with configuring IAM on the major cloud providers should feel comfortable with the basic concepts:

- Service Accounts
- Tokens
- Roles
- Policies

## Components

### Service Accounts

Service Accounts represent your unique workloads.
We recommend creating a Service Account for each application that will access the SpiceDB API.

By default Service Accounts have no access to the SpiceDB API; you must apply a Role to gain access.

### Tokens

Tokens are long-lived credentials for Service Accounts.
SpiceDB clients must provide a Token in the Authorization header of an API request to perform actions granted to the Service Account.

Service Accounts can have an arbitrary number of Tokens.

<Callout type="info">We recommend deploying new Tokens before deprovisioning any old Tokens to avoid downtime.</Callout>

#### Token Format

<Callout type="warning">The entire contents of a Token is considered secret.</Callout>

Tokens come in the form of `{prefix}_{key}`.

Here's what an example Restricted API Access Token looks like.

```
sdbst_h256_thisisnotaverysecuresecret
```

This is what you should forward in your API calls to your AuthZed Dedicated cluster.

If you are using [static configuration] in your own SpiceDB Enterprise deployment, you'd need to
generate a token hash to be included in your configuration YAML.
Please note you should hash the cleartext secret without the prefix.
You can generate the hash of a secret as follows:

```command
echo -n thisisnotaverysecuresecret | sha256sum
```

The command should output the hash, which can be referenced in your static configuration

```

### Roles

Roles define rules for accessing the SpiceDB API.
Roles are bound to Service Accounts to apply those rules to all API Tokens representing the Service Account.

Each rule is composed of an SpiceDB API method (e.g. `CheckPermissions`, `WriteRelationships`) and an optional [CEL expression][cel].
Rules are evaluated at request-time and CEL expressions are provided the request payload in order to dynamically evaluate each request.

Any public SpiceDB API type is available to the CEL expression so that you can traverse any type and its fields using language operators.
For more details on CEL's language definition, refer to [CEL language specification][cel-lang-spec].

The following variables are provided the CEL expression varying based on the request method:

- `WriteRelationshipsRequest`
- `ReadRelationshipsRequest`
- `DeleteRelationshipsRequest`
- `WriteSchemaRequest`
- `ReadSchemaRequest`
- `CheckPermissionRequest`
- `LookupResourcesRequest`
- `LookupSubjectsRequest`
- `ExpandPermissionTreeRequest`
- `WatchRequest`

### Policies

Policies are what bind Roles to a Service Account.

Each policy is composed of a unique identifer for the policy itself, the principal (the target of the role assignment), and any roles being assigned.

## Task-Specific Configuration

### `zed backup`/`zed restore`

To configure a service account for use with `zed backup` and `zed restore`, you'll need the following APIs:

On a Service Account on the **source** PS:

```yaml
## For backup
# Exporting relationships
authzed.api/ExportBulkRelationships
authzed.api/BulkExportRelationships

# Dumping existing schema
authzed.api/ReadSchema
```

On a Service Account on the **destination** PS:

```yaml
## For restore
## Put these on the DESTINATION PS
# Importing relationships
authzed.api/ImportBulkRelationships
authzed.api/BulkImportRelationships

# Retrying failed relationships
authzed.api/WriteRelationships

# Writing new schema
authzed.api/WriteSchema
```

## Example Rule CEL Expressions

These are some examples of CEL expressions that you might attach to Permissions on a Role.

### Resource-type Write Limit

This CEL expression disables the ability for writes to occur on anything but the provided resource type.

This is useful for limiting an application to only be able to perform writes to SpiceDB for the type objects that it owns.

```cel
WriteRelationshipsRequest.updates.all(x, x.relationship.resource.object_type == "resource")
```

### Subject-type Write Limit

This CEL expression disables the ability for writes to occur on anything but the provided subject type.

```cel
WriteRelationshipsRequest.updates.all(x, x.relationship.subject.object.object_type == "user")
```

### Create-only Write Limit

This CEL expression disables the ability for writes to perform updates; they can only create new relationships.

```cel
WriteRelationshipsRequest.updates.all(
  x,
  x.operation == authzed.api.v1.RelationshipUpdate.Operation.OPERATION_CREATE,
)
```

### Resource-type Read Limit

This CEL expression limits the ReadRelationships API from being able to list anything but the a specific resource type.

```cel
ReadRelationshipsRequest.relationship_filter.resource_type == "resource"
```

### Blocking Schema Writes

This CEL expression prevents any schema writes that contain the substring "blockchain".
This example could be extended to prevent PII or undesirable patterns from reaching a production schema.

```cel
!WriteSchemaRequest.schema.contains("blockchain")
```

### Limit Checks to one Permission

This CEL expression limits CheckPermissions requests to only be able to check a particular permission.

```cel
CheckPermissionRequest.permission == "admin"
```

## Static Configuration

Enterprise builds of SpiceDB can have their API access configured statically with a YAML configuration file.

<Callout type="warning">
  These configuration files contain hashes of Tokens and should be treated like secrets.
</Callout>

This functionality is configured with the following flag:

- `--extender-enabled authzed-fgam`
- `--extender-authzed-fgam-endpoint /path/to/configuration.yaml`

Here's an example showcasing the structure of static configuration:

```yaml
role:
  - id: "admin"
    permission:
      authzed.v1/ReadSchema:           ""
      authzed.v1/WriteSchema:          ""
      authzed.v1/ReadRelationships:    ""
      authzed.v1/WriteRelationships:   ""
      authzed.v1/DeleteRelationships:  ""
      authzed.v1/CheckPermission:      ""
      authzed.v1/LookupResources:      ""
      authzed.v1/LookupSubjects:       ""
      authzed.v1/ExpandPermissionTree: ""
      authzed.v1/Watch:                ""
service_account:
  - id: "my_microservice"
    token:
      - id: "token_01"
        hash: "71c73ba92f2032416b18a4f4fffb2a825755bea6a8430f2622ab1f3fb35a10d0"
      - id: "token_02"
        hash: "fcdfc4fa3c5c7381789d90c3c67f6cebf151cbf7e7555e91e77be2aa3e0a4bdf"
policy:
  - id: "microservice_with_admin"
    principal_id: "my_microservice"
    principal_type: "service_account"
    roles:
      - "admin"
```

## Enabling without downtime

If you want to apply a static configuration to an existing SpiceDB cluster without downtime, you must conduct an upgrade process with the following steps:

1. Create pre-shared keys that follow the token format for each client of your SpiceDB instance.
   You should add those to your SpiceDB instance configuration.
   You can do this by defining multiple PSKs via the ENV or flags as comma separated values.
2. Update all your clients to use those new PSKs.
3. Prepare the FGAM configuration YAML.
   This process heavily depends on what each client needs:
     1. You may want to start with FGAM tokens bound to a admin-like Role, since that's what the original PSKs effectively were.
        This is probably lower risk, and then from there you can move to start trimming down permissions.
     2. Or you may want to move directly to downscoped tokens for your individual services, creating the tokens you need.
        This may be simple if you have few clients, but more complex as the number of clients grow, and with a bigger blast radious of impact on rollout.
4. Deploy SpiceDB with the new configuration
