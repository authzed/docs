# Feature Maturity

In order to provide a balance between stability and the ability to adopt new functionality in its early stages, features developed by AuthZed are classified under one of three states of maturity.

## Tech Preview

Tech Preview features provide the earliest access to upcoming product innovations, enabling you to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

Because Tech Preview features are still under development, AuthZed cannot guarantee the stability of such features.
These features can change dramatically in design or be dropped altogether without ever reaching a stable release.
Because this phase of development is intended for collecting requirements, there are no timelines for future stable releases.

Customers will be informed by their account teams about the availability of Tech Preview features that might be relevant to them.

## Early Access

Early Access features provide early access to upcoming product features that are stable but not necessarily fully featured or self-service.

Because Early Access features are still under development, AuthZed can only make guarantees about the stability of such features on a case-by-case basis.
These features should not have fundamental changes during this time, but should expand functionality over time.

Customers will be informed by their account teams about the availability of Early Access features that might be relevant to them.

## General Availability

General Availability features provide access to all users the ability to self-service the enablement and configuration of a fully supported feature with accordance to their respective Service Level Agreements (SLAs).

Generally Available features have been operated in Early Access for a period of at least a month while meeting defined product-level Service Level Objectives (SLOs).
This provides an opportunity for our operations team to define and test all Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) required.

Customers should be able to find all Generally Available features within the AuthZed dashboard and documentation websites.
