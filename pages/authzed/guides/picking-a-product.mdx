  **Info:**
  We're currently admitting folks into the wait-list for AuthZed Cloud Early Access.

  To apply, [schedule a call](https://authzed.com/call).
</Callout>

AuthZed Cloud is our upcoming, self-service authorization platform.

Upcoming functionality includes:

- Creating organizations, teams, and delegating access with your SSO provider
- Commitment-free, monthly pricing
- Workload Isolation vastly improving performance & latency
- Deployments in more regions, including Europe
- Full SpiceDB API access: Watch API, HTTP API
- Enterprise features like Audit Logs, Restricted API Access

AuthZed Cloud is built on the same foundation that's serving critical production workloads in AuthZed Dedicated.
During Early Access, the self-service control-plane functionality is considered experimental, but SpiceDB continues to operate with its existing level of reliability and performance.

### Open Source

We understand that AuthZed's product suite will not satisfy all use cases and, for that reason, we've built and continue to invest in an open-source community around SpiceDB.

Community support is available to absolutely everyone and does not require any form of payment or usage of AuthZed products.

[Discord] is the first line of support for asking questions or getting help with SpiceDB in real time.
[GitHub Discussions] is also available for asynchronous questions.
For bug reports, feature requests, and development discussion, [GitHub Issues] are available to all for participation.

<Callout type="info">
  The community encompasses not only folks paid to contribute, but maintainers and end-users volunteering their time to answer your questions.

  Please be respectful and read over the community [Code of Conduct] before interacting.
