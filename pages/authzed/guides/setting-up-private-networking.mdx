# Setting up Private Networking

This guide walks through setting up AuthZed Dedicated [Private Networking].

[Private Networking]: ../concepts/private-networking

<Callout type="info">
  Private networking is recommended, but optional. Authzed Dedicated can be configured to allow for connecting from the public internet.
</Callout>

## AWS Steps

<Steps>

### Onboarding

The customer success team at AuthZed should reach out about Private Networking during onboarding.

In the case where there's any miscommunication, please reach out via Slack or [schedule a call][call].

### Creating a VPC Endpoint

[AWS PrivateLink] is the core technology involved in this process.

[AWS PrivateLink]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-privatelink/aws-privatelink.html

Log into the AWS web console for the account you plan to peer.

Navigate to `VPC` → `Endpoints` → `Create Endpoint` and input the following info:

| Option               | Selection            |
| :-------------------:| :-------------------:|
| Name tag         | Choose whatever you want |
| Service category   | Select “Endpoint services that use NLBs and GWLBs” |
| Service name       | Enter the "service name" provided to you by the AuthZed team |
| VPC                | Choose the VPC from where you will deploy your SpiceDB client. DNS resolution for your SpiceDB cluster endpoint address will only be available from this VPC. |
| Subnets            | You can deploy your VPC endpoint in one subnet per AZ. We recommend choosing all AZs where SpiceDB clients will exist. |
| IP address type    | IPV4 |
| Security Group     | Choose a security group that allows inbound port 443 traffic from your clients |

When you're ready to create the new resource, click `Create endpoint`

### Enabling DNS for the Endpoint

By default, VPC Endpoints do not have access to public DNS.
This is a reasonable default for internal networking, but AuthZed publishes public DNS.
In order to make connections from your systems resilient to changing IP addresses, we will enable it.

Navigate to the Endpoint that was just created, select `Actions` from the drop-down menu, and select `Modify private DNS name` from the next drop-down menu.

Check `Enable for this endpoint` and then click `Save changes` to persist this setting.

### Create a Permissions System

You can skip this section if you've already created a Permissions System.

1. Login to your SpiceDB management console
2. On the homepage, select `Add Permissions System`
3. Configure your permission system to your liking and create it

### Verify Connectivity

Ensure the next steps are executed on a machine that is in your internal network.
This might be your local machine, if your corporate VPN is peered with your cloud networks otherwise you'll probably have to create a container or EC2 instance in the network.

There are a variety of ways to interact with the SpiceDB API, but for this guide we'll be using the official command-line client, [Zed].

If you don't already have zed installed, you can follow [this guide][install-zed].

For zed to connect to SpiceDB, we'll first have to create an context named `network-test` for connecting to our locally forwarded port:

```sh
zed context set network-test example.us-east-1.aws.authzed.net:443 sdbst_h256_cef4fc239bf...
```

With our context set, we're free to make requests to our Permission System:

```sh
zed schema read
```

If all is successful, you should see your schema or an empty Permission System should have thrown an error:

```
code = NotFound
desc = No schema has been defined; please call WriteSchema to start
```
