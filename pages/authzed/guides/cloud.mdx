## Create a Permissions System on AuthZed Cloud

Sign in to [AuthZed Cloud](https://app.authzed.cloud) and click on the **+Create** button to create a Permissions System (PS) and fill in the necessary details:

- The type can be either "Production" or "Development".
- Give it a name.
- Choose the underlying datastore.
- The update channel can be either be `rapid` or `regular` which determines the behavior of automatic updates when new SpiceDB releases are made available:
  - `rapid` gets the latest release immediately.
  - `regular` is one release behind.
- Add SpiceDB deployments:
  - Give them a name.
  - Choose the region where the deployment will live.
  - Choose the number of vCPUs for your deployment. The recommendation is to start with 2 vCPUs and then monitor the Metrics and change it based on your workload.
  - Choose the number of replicas to deploy SpiceDB with primarily read workloads. The recommendation is 3 but will depend on your latency requirements.

## Configuring Access

Before using the Permissions System, let's configure access to it.
This functionality enables organizations to apply the principle of least-privilege to services accessing SpiceDB.
For example, read-only tokens can be created for services that should never need to write to SpiceDB.
Read more about it [here](https://authzed.com/docs/authzed/concepts/restricted-api-access)

Let’s start by creating a **Service Account** which is something that represents your unique workload.
We recommend creating a Service Account for each application that will access the SpiceDB API.
Add a name such as `blog-app` and a description before hitting Save.

Now let’s create a **token**.
Tokens are long-lived credentials for Service Accounts.
SpiceDB clients must provide a Token in the Authorization header of an API request to perform actions granted to the Service Account.
Click on the `blog-app` service account you just created and then the Tokens item in the menu.
Create a token by providing a name and description.

Let’s now provide a **Role** and attach a **Policy** to that Role.
A Role defines rules for accessing the SpiceDB API.
Roles are bound to Service Accounts.
Click the Roles -> Create Role and provide a name and a description.
Add the following permissions for this demo:

```
ReadSchema
WriteSchema
DeleteRelationships
ReadRelationships
WriteRelationships
CheckPermission
```

Finally, let’s create a Policy.
Policies are what bind Roles to a Service Account.
Click on Policies -> Create policy.
Provide a name and a description and pick the Service Account and Role created in the steps above to bind the two.

You’re now ready to use your Permissions System!
