# Model Context Protocol

## Overview

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables large language models (LLMs) to communicate with external tools and data sources. Often referred to as "USB-C for AI", MCP provides a universal interface that allows AI applications to integrate once and interoperate with any MCP-compatible system.

By standardizing how AI tools access external data and functionality, MCP eliminates the need for custom integrations between every AI application and every external service.

## Understanding MCP

### The Problem MCP Solves

LLMs face fundamental limitations when providing contextually relevant responses:

- **Limited knowledge cutoff**: Models are trained on data up to a specific point in time and lack access to real-time or current information
- **No external data access**: LLMs cannot natively access databases, APIs, or external systems
- **Manual context augmentation**: Previously, users had to manually copy and paste relevant data into chat interfaces
- **Integration complexity**: AI coding assistants required custom-built integrations with databases and backend systems for each deployment

### How MCP Works

The MCP specification standardizes how AI tools interact with data sources and functionality. Instead of building separate integrations for each AI application and external service, developers implement MCP once and gain compatibility across the entire ecosystem.

MCP uses a client-server architecture:

- **MCP Host**: The AI application that users interact with (IDEs like Cursor or Windsurf, chat applications like ChatGPT or Claude, AI agents)
- **MCP Client**: The connection component within the host that communicates with external services
- **MCP Server**: The external service being accessed (databases, APIs, cloud services)

Each MCP host must create and manage separate MCP client connections for each MCP server it communicates with. This architecture enables AI applications to access multiple data sources and tools simultaneously while maintaining clear separation between services.

## Core Capabilities

MCP provides three primitives for extending LLM functionality:

### Resources

Resources inject information into the AI's context. This includes configuration data, documentation, company policies, product catalogs, or customer information. Resources enable AI models to work with accurate, current data without manual intervention.

**Example use case**: When drafting a customer email, automatically provide the customer's order history, support ticket details, and account preferences so the AI can write personalized, contextually accurate responses.

### Tools

Tools enable AI models to trigger actions on behalf of users based on goals and information in the context. They allow AI to interact with external systems, automating tasks that would otherwise require manual execution across multiple applications.

**Example use case**: Create a new project in your task management system, assign team members, set deadlines, and generate initial task lists—all from a single conversation with the AI, without switching between applications.

### Prompts

Prompts provide tested, reusable instructions that guide AI behavior consistently. Instead of users needing to craft precise instructions each time, MCP servers can supply pre-configured prompts that have been refined for specific tasks or contexts.

**Example use case**: When analyzing customer feedback, use a standardized prompt that ensures the AI always considers sentiment, key themes, and actionable insights in a consistent format across your team.

## Security and Authorization

### Evolution of the Specification

The MCP specification has evolved rapidly since its introduction, with three major releases in under eight months:

- **2024-11-05**: Initial specification release
- **2025-03-26**: Enhanced security features
- **2025-06-18**: Enterprise readiness improvements

The most recent versions have focused heavily on security and enterprise readiness, introducing mechanisms to authenticate users and clients while providing recommendations for authorizing resource access. The ability to implement granular access controls for resources is especially critical for enterprises integrating sensitive company and user data with MCP servers.

### Deployment Considerations

MCP servers can be deployed in two primary configurations, each with distinct authorization requirements:

#### Local MCP Servers

Local servers run as single instances on individual machines. These servers are assumed to be under the custodian of the user running them. Most MCP clients provide functionality that prompts users to approve tool invocations and resource access before execution. While this provides a basic security layer, it relies on user vigilance and awareness.

#### Remote MCP Servers

Remote servers are hosted and accessed in multi-tenant environments, serving multiple users and organizations. These deployments require robust authentication and access control mechanisms for MCP resources. The MCP specification provides high-level guidance for authorization, but implementation details—including specific permission models and accurate enforcement—are the responsibility of MCP server developers.

### Security Risks: The Lethal Trifecta

Security researcher Simon Willison identified a [dangerous combination of capabilities](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/) that can lead to data theft in AI systems:

1. **Access to your private data**: One of the most common purposes of tools in the first place
2. **Exposure to untrusted content**: Any mechanism by which text or images controlled by a malicious attacker could become available to your LLM
3. **The ability to externally communicate**: Methods that could be used to exfiltrate your data

Implementing robust authorization in your MCP server can mitigate these risks within your service. However, once data from your MCP server is sent to the MCP host application and becomes part of the context, you lose control over access to that data. AI applications often have multiple MCP servers enabled simultaneously, and you cannot enforce permissions for actions taken on your data within other servers or the host application itself.

### Best Practices

This limitation underscores the importance of:

- Implementing least-privilege access controls
- Carefully evaluating which data to expose through MCP resources
- Understanding the trust boundaries between your MCP server and the host application
- Considering data sensitivity when designing your MCP server's capabilities
