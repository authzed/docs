# SpiceDB Dev MCP Server

<Callout type="info">
  The SpiceDB Dev MCP server is available as a Tech Preview. Tech Preview features provide the earliest access to upcoming product innovations, enabling you to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
</Callout>

Run a local SpiceDB development environment directly in your AI coding assistant. Build, test, and debug permissions systems interactively with an in-memory SpiceDB instance.

## Overview

SpiceDB Dev MCP Server is a local development tool that runs an in-memory SpiceDB instance accessible through MCP. It's designed for developers actively building permissions systems who want to iterate quickly on schemas and test permission logic with AI assistance.

**Key characteristics**:
- Runs locally on your machine
- In-memory only (no persistence)
- No external dependencies
- Does not connect to running SpiceDB instances
- Integrated with Zed CLI

Perfect for: schema development, permission testing, learning SpiceDB through hands-on practice, debugging authorization logic.

## Prerequisites

Install the latest version of the zed CLI:

[Installing zed](/spicedb/getting-started/installing-zed)

## Starting the Server

Start the development server:

```bash
zed mcp run
```

The server starts on `http://localhost:9999/mcp` with an empty in-memory SpiceDB instance.

**Important**: The server runs in-memory only. All schemas and relationships are lost when you stop the server.

## Connecting Clients

### Claude Code

To use with Claude Code, run `zed mcp run` to start the SpiceDB Dev MCP server and then run the following to add the server to your Claude Code integrations:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http spicedb http://localhost:9999/mcp
```

Then start developing:

```bash
claude
```

### Other Clients

For MCP clients supporting HTTP transport, configure:
```
Transport: HTTP
URL: http://localhost:9999/mcp
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Write a Schema

Start by defining your authorization model:

> You: "Create a schema for a document sharing system. Documents have owners, editors, and viewers. Owners can share documents, editors can edit, and viewers can only read."

The assistant uses `write_schema` to create the schema in your development instance.

### 2. Create Test Data

Build relationships to test your model:

> You: "Create test data where alice owns doc:readme, bob is an editor, and charlie is a viewer."

The assistant uses `update_relationships` to populate your instance with test relationships.

### 3. Test Permissions

Validate your authorization logic:

> You: "Can charlie edit doc:readme?"

The assistant uses `check_permission` to test the logic and returns `NO_PERMISSION` (charlie is only a viewer).

> You: "Can bob edit doc:readme?"

Returns `HAS_PERMISSION` (bob is an editor).

### 4. Explore the Graph

Query your authorization relationships:

> You: "Which documents can alice share?"

The assistant uses `lookup_resources` to show all documents alice has owner permissions on.

> You: "Who can view doc:readme?"

The assistant uses `lookup_subjects` to show alice, bob, and charlie.

### 5. Iterate

Refine your schema based on testing:

> You: "Add a manager role that can edit and also share documents"

The assistant updates the schema with `write_schema` and you can immediately test the new permissions.

## Available Tools

**`write_schema`** - Write or update the SpiceDB schema

**`update_relationships`** - Add or update relationships in the instance

**`delete_relationships`** - Remove relationships from the instance

**`check_permission`** - Check if a subject has a specific permission on a resource

**`lookup_resources`** - Find all resources a subject can access with a given permission

**`lookup_subjects`** - Find all subjects that have a given permission on a resource

## Available Resources

**`schema://current`** - View the current SpiceDB schema

**`relationships://all`** - View all relationships in the instance

**`instructions://`** - Get instructions on using the development server

**`validation://current`** - Access the current validation file for testing

## Development Tips

### Iterative Development

1. Start with a simple schema
2. Add test relationships
3. Check permissions to validate behavior
4. Refine the schema based on results
5. Repeat

### Testing Edge Cases

Use the development server to test:
- Indirect permissions through [subject relations](/spicedb/concepts/schema#subject-relations)
- Complex permission unions and intersections
- Caveat evaluation with different contexts
- Deeply nested organizational hierarchies

### Validation Files

Use validation files to:
- Define expected permission outcomes
- Test your schema systematically
- Document authorization requirements
- Share test cases with your team

Access with `validation://current` resource.

## Security Considerations

### Local Development Only

**Never use in production**:
- No authentication or authorization on the server itself
- In-memory only, no data persistence
- Designed for localhost access only
- No audit logging or compliance features

### Network Isolation

- Server binds to localhost (127.0.0.1) by default
- Do not expose port 9999 to external networks

### Test Data Only

- Use fictional data, never real user information
- Do not test with production credentials
- Avoid sensitive or confidential information
- Remember: all data is lost on shutdown

### Development Hygiene

- Track schemas in version control
- Document permission models separately
- Review schemas before production deployment
- Use validation files to capture test cases

## Troubleshooting

### Server Won't Start

**Check Zed CLI installation**:
```bash
zed version
```

**Port 9999 in use**:
```bash
# macOS/Linux
lsof -i :9999

# Windows
netstat -an | findstr 9999
```

**Solution**: Stop the conflicting process or restart your machine.

### Client Connection Fails

- Verify server is running: `zed mcp run` should be active
- Confirm URL is `http://localhost:9999/mcp`
- Check client supports HTTP transport
- Ensure localhost is not blocked by firewall

### Schema Errors

**Syntax errors**: Review against [SpiceDB schema documentation](#)

**Undefined types**: Ensure all referenced types are defined in the schema

**View detailed errors**: Access `validation://current` resource

### Unexpected Permission Results

**Debug process**:
1. View current schema: `schema://current`
2. List all relationships: `relationships://all`
3. Check indirect permission paths
4. Use lookup tools to explore the authorization graph
5. Verify relation chains are correct

### Data Loss

**Remember**: The server is in-memory only. All data is lost when stopped.

**To preserve work**:
- Save schemas to files regularly
- Export relationships for test cases
- Use validation files to document expected behavior
- Commit schemas to version control frequently

## Moving to Production

When ready to move beyond development:

1. **Export your schema**: Save the final schema from `schema://current`
2. **Document permissions**: Create comprehensive validation files
3. **Deploy SpiceDB**: See [SpiceDB deployment guide](#)
4. **Connect your application**: Use [SpiceDB client libraries](#)
5. **Import relationships**: Migrate test relationships if appropriate
6. **Test thoroughly**: Validate in staging before production

The development server is not suitable for production use. Deploy a proper SpiceDB instance with authentication, persistence, and monitoring.
