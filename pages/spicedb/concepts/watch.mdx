# Watching Relationship Changes

The [Watch API] in SpiceDB enables clients to monitor changes made to [Relationships] within the system.

Watch events are generated when relationships are created, touched, or deleted through the [WriteRelationships], [DeleteRelationships] or [ImportBulkRelationships] APIs.

[Watch API]: https://buf.build/authzed/api/docs/main:authzed.api.v1#authzed.api.v1.WatchService
[Relationships]: relationships
[WriteRelationships]: https://buf.build/authzed/api/docs/main:authzed.api.v1#authzed.api.v1.PermissionsService.WriteRelationships
[DeleteRelationships]: https://buf.build/authzed/api/docs/main:authzed.api.v1#authzed.api.v1.PermissionsService.DeleteRelationships
[ImportBulkRelationships]: https://buf.build/authzed/api/docs/main:authzed.api.v1#authzed.api.v1.PermissionsService.ImportBulkRelationships

## Calling Watch

To receive watch changes, call the `Watch` API.

This is a streaming API that will continually return all updates to relationships from the time at which the API call was made.

```py
from authzed.api.v1 import (
    Client, WatchRequest
)
from grpcutil import bearer_token_credentials

client = Client(
    "localhost:50051",
    bearer_token_credentials("your-token-here"),
)

watcher = client.Watch(WatchRequest{})
for resp in watcher:
  # process the update
```

### Receiving historical updates

Historical updates (i.e. relationship changes in the past) can be retrieved by specifying a [ZedToken] in the `WatchRequest`:

[ZedToken]: consistency#zedtokens

```py
from authzed.api.v1 import (
    Client, WatchRequest
)
from grpcutil import bearer_token_credentials

client = Client(
    "localhost:50051",
    bearer_token_credentials("your-token-here"),
)

watcher = client.Watch(WatchRequest(
  optional_start_cursor=last_zed_token
))
for resp in watcher:
  # process the update
```

<Callout type="info">
  Historical changes can only be requested until the configured garbage
  collection window on the underlying datastore. This is typically 24 hours, but
  may differ based on the datastore used.
</Callout>

### Ensuring continuous processing

Because Watch is a streaming API, your code should handle disconnections gracefully.

To ensure continuous processing, the calling client _should_ execute the `Watch` call in a loop, sending in the last received [ZedToken] from `ChangesThrough` if the call disconnects:

```py
from authzed.api.v1 import (
    Client, WatchRequest
)
from grpcutil import bearer_token_credentials

client = Client(
    "localhost:50051",
    bearer_token_credentials("your-token-here"),
)

last_zed_token = None
while not_canceled:
  try:
    watcher = client.Watch(WatchRequest(
      optional_start_cursor=last_zed_token
    ))
    for resp in watcher:
      # process the update
      last_zed_token = resp.changes_through
  except Exception:
    # log exception
    continue
```

If your datastore supports checkpoints, you can also request them.

This will help keep the stream alive during periods of inactivity, which is helpful if your SpiceDB instance sits behind a proxy that terminates idle connections.

```py
from authzed.api.v1 import (
    Client,
    WatchRequest,
)
from authzed.api.v1.watch_service_pb2 import WATCH_KIND_INCLUDE_CHECKPOINTS
from grpcutil import bearer_token_credentials

client = Client(
    "localhost:50051",
    bearer_token_credentials("your-token-here"),
)

last_zed_token = None
while not_canceled:
  try:
    watcher = client.Watch(WatchRequest(
      optional_start_cursor=last_zed_token,
      optional_update_kinds=[WATCH_KIND_INCLUDE_CHECKPOINTS]
    ))
    for resp in watcher:
      # process the update
      last_zed_token = resp.changes_through
  except Exception:
    # log exception
    continue
```

## Transaction Metadata

SpiceDB's [WriteRelationships] and [DeleteRelationships] APIs support an optional metadata block called the [Transaction Metadata].

When `optional_transaction_metadata` is specified on the [WriteRelationships] or [DeleteRelationships] request, it will be stored and returned alongside the relationships in the Watch API:

```py
from authzed.api.v1 import (
    Client, WatchRequest
)
from grpcutil import bearer_token_credentials

client = Client(
    "localhost:50051",
    bearer_token_credentials("your-token-here"),
)
client.WriteRelationships(WriteRelationshipsRequest(
  updates=[
      RelationshipUpdate(
                operation=RelationshipUpdate.Operation.OPERATION_CREATE,
                relationship=Relationship(
                    resource=ObjectReference(object_type="document", object_id="somedoc"),
                    relation="viewer",
                    subject=SubjectReference(
                        object=ObjectReference(
                            object_type="user",
                            object_id="tom",
                        )
                    ),
                ),
      ),
  ],
  optional_transaction_metadata=Struct({"request_id": "12345"}),
})

...

WatchResponse{
  Updates: [
    { Relationship: "document:somedoc#viewer@user:tom" }
  ],
  OptionalTransactionMetadata: {
    "request_id": "12345"
  }
}

```

This allows callers to correlate write operations and the updates that come from the Watch API.
