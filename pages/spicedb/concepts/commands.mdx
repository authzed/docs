# Commands

SpiceDB provides customization of runtime behavior with a variety command-line flags, but also provides multiple commands that operate SpiceDB in various modes.

## Global Flags

The following are configuration flags that can be provided to every SpiceDB command.

| Flag | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| --log-format | format of logs ("auto", "console", "json") | `auto` |
| --log-level | verbosity of logging ("trace", "debug", "info", "warn", "error") | `info` |
| --otel-endpoint | OpenTelemetry collector endpoint - the endpoint can also be set by using environment variables |  |
| --otel-insecure | connect to the OpenTelemetry collector in plaintext |  |
| --otel-provider | OpenTelemetry provider for tracing ("none", "otlphttp", "otlpgrpc") | `none` |
| --otel-sample-ratio | ratio of traces that are sampled | `0.01` |
| --otel-service-name | service name for trace data | `spicedb` |
| --otel-trace-propagator | OpenTelemetry trace propagation format ("b3", "w3c", "ottrace") | `w3c` |
| --skip-release-check | if true, skips checking for new SpiceDB releases |  |
| --termination-log-path | define the path to the termination log file, which contains a JSON payload to surface as reason for termination - disabled by default |  |

## Migrate

### Flags

| Flag | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| --datastore-conn-uri | connection string used by remote datastores (e.g. "postgres://postgres:password@localhost:5432/spicedb") |  |
