# Caveats

Caveats are a feature within SpiceDB that allows for relationships to be defined conditionally: the relationship will only be considered present if the caveat expression evaluates to true.

Caveats allow for an elegant way to model dynamic policies and ABAC-style (Attribute Based Access Control) decisions while still providing scalability and performance guarantees.

## Defining Caveats

Caveats are named expressions that are defined in schema alongside definitions for object types.
A caveat definition includes a name, one or more well-typed parameters, and a [CEL expression] returning a boolean value.

[CEL expression]: https://github.com/google/cel-spec

Here's schema snippet demonstrating what a simple caveat looks like:

```zed
caveat first_caveat(first_parameter int, second_parameter string) {
  first_parameter == 42 && second_parameter == "hello world"
}
```

### Parameter Types

The following table documents the CEL types available for values in caveat expressions:

| Type      | Description                                      |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `any`       | any value is allowed; useful for types that vary |
| `int`       | 64-bit signed integer                            |
| `uint`      | 64-bit unsigned integer                          |
| `bool`      | boolean                                          |
| `string`    | utf8-encoded string                              |
| `double`    | double-width floating point number               |
| `bytes`     | sequence of uint8                                |
| `duration`  | duration of time                                 |
| `timestamp` | specific moment in time (typically UTC)          |
| `list<T>`   | generic sequence of values                       |
| `map<T>`    | generic mapping of strings to values             |
| `ipaddress` | spicedb-specific type for IP addresses           |

Developers looking for the SpiceDB code that defines of these types can find them in the [pkg/caveats/types module].

### Some Examples

#### Basic comparison

```zed
caveat is_tuesday(today string) {
   today == 'tuesday'
}
```

#### Attribute Matching

The example below defines a caveat that requires that any expected attributes found within the expected map are a subset of the attributes in the provided map:

```zed
caveat attributes_match(expected map<any>, provided map<any>) {
   expected.isSubtreeOf(provided)
}
```

#### IP address checking

The example below defines a caveat that requires that a user’s IP address is within a specific CIDR range:

```zed
caveat ip_allowlist(user_ip ipaddress, cidr string) {
  user_ip.in_cidr(cidr)
}
```

## Allowing caveats on relations

To allow a caveat to be used when writing a relationship, the caveat must be specified on the relation within the schema via the **with** keyword:

```zed
definition resource {
  relation viewer: user | user with ip_allowlist
}
```

In the above example, a relationship can be written for the `viewer` relation to a `user` without a caveat OR with the `ip_allowlist` caveat.

To make the caveat **required**, the `user |` can be removed.

## Writing relationships with caveats and context

When writing a relationship for a relation, both the caveat and a portion of the “context” can be specified:

```textproto
WriteRelationshipsRequest {
  Updates: [
    RelationshipUpdate{
      Operation: CREATE
      Relationship: {
        Resource: …,
        Relation: "viewer",
        Subject: …,
        OptionalCaveat: {
           CaveatName: "ip_allowlist",
           Context: structpb{ "cidr": "1.2.3.0/24" }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

A few important notes:

- The **Context** of a caveat is defined both by the values written in the `Relationship`, as well as those provided in the `CheckPermissionRequest`: if empty, then only the context specified on a CheckPermission request will be used.
  Otherwise, the values in the `Relationship` take precedence over those in the `CheckPermissionRequest`.
  - Context of a caveat provided in `Relationship` is stored alongside the relationship and is provided to the caveat expression at runtime.
    This allows for **partial** binding of data at write time.
- The Context is a `structpb`, which is defined by Google and represents JSON-like data: [https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/protobuf/types/known/structpb](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/protobuf/types/known/structpb)
  - To send 64-bit integers, encode them as strings.
- A relationship cannot be duplicated, with or without a caveat, e.g. two relationships that differ only on their use of a caveat cannot both exist.
- When deleting a relationship, a caveat does not need to be specified; the matching relationship will be deleted if present.

## Issuing Checks

When issuing a [CheckPermission request][check-req], additional caveat context can be specified to represent the known context at the time of the check:

```textproto
CheckPermissionRequest {
  Resource: …,
  Permission: …,
  Subject: …,
  Context: { "user_ip": "1.2.3.4" }
}
```

The check engine will automatically apply the context found on the relationships, as well as the context provided by the CheckPermission call, and return [one of three states][states]:

- `PERMISSIONSHIP_NO_PERMISSION` - subject does not have the permission on the resource
- `PERMISSIONSHIP_HAS_PERMISSION` - subject has permission on the resource
- `PERMISSIONSHIP_CONDITIONAL_PERMISSION` - required context is missing to determine permissionship

In the case of `PERMISSIONSHIP_CONDITIONAL_PERMISSION`, SpiceDB will also return the missing context fields in the [CheckPermissionResponse][check-resp] so the caller knows what additional context to fill in if they wish to rerun the check and get a determined answer.

[check-req]: https://buf.build/authzed/api/docs/main:authzed.api.v1#authzed.api.v1.PermissionsService.CheckPermission
[states]: https://buf.build/authzed/api/docs/main:authzed.api.v1#authzed.api.v1.CheckPermissionResponse.Permissionship
[check-resp]: https://buf.build/authzed/api/docs/main:authzed.api.v1#authzed.api.v1.CheckPermissionResponse

## LookupResources and LookupSubjects

Similarly to **CheckPermission**, both **LookupResources** and **LookupSubjects** can be provided with additional context and will return one of the two permission states for each of the results found (either has permission or conditionally has permission).

## Full Example

A full example of a schema with caveats can be found below, which allows users to `view` a resource if they are directly a `viewer` or they are a`viewer` within the correct IP CIDR range:

### Schema

```zed
definition user {}

caveat has_valid_ip(user_ip ipaddress, allowed_range string) {
  user_ip.in_cidr(allowed_range)
}

definition resource {
    relation viewer: user | user with has_valid_ip
    permission view = viewer
}
```

### Write Relationships

```textproto
WriteRelationshipsRequest {
  Updates: [
    RelationshipUpdate{
      Operation: CREATE
      Relationship: {
        Resource: {
            ObjectType: "resource",
            ObjectId: "someresource",
        },
        Relation: "viewer",
        Subject: {
            ObjectType: "user",
            ObjectId: "sarah",
        },
        OptionalCaveat: {
           CaveatName: "has_valid_ip",
           Context: structpb{ "allowed_range": "10.20.30.0/24" }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Check Permission

```textproto
CheckPermissionRequest {
    Resource: {
        ObjectType: "resource",
        ObjectId: "someresource",
    },
    Permission: "view",
    Subject: {
        ObjectType: "user",
        ObjectId: "sarah",
    },
    Context: { "user_ip": "10.20.30.42" }
}
```

## Validation with Caveats

The [Assertions] and [Expected Relations] definitions for validation of schema support caveats as well.

[assertions]: /spicedb/modeling/developing-a-schema#assertions
[expected relations]: /spicedb/modeling/developing-a-schema#expected-relations

### Assertions

Caveated permissions can be checked in assertions by the addition of the `assertCaveated` block:

```yaml filename="Assertions for caveated permissions"
assertTrue:
  - "document:specificdocument#reader@user:specificuser"
assertCaveated:
  - "document:specificdocument#reader@user:caveateduser"
assertFalse:
  - "document:specificdocument#reader@user:anotheruser"
```

To assert that a permission does or does not exist when some context it specified, the `with` keyword can be used to provide the context:

```yaml filename="Assertions for caveated permissions with context"
assertTrue:
  - "document:specificdocument#reader@user:specificuser"
  - 'document:specificdocument#reader@user:caveateduser with {"somecondition": true}'
assertCaveated:
  - "document:specificdocument#reader@user:caveateduser"
assertFalse:
  - "document:specificdocument#reader@user:anotheruser"
  - 'document:specificdocument#reader@user:caveateduser with {"somecondition": false}'
```

### Expected Relations

Expected relations notes if a subject is caveated via the inclusion of the `[...]` string on the end of the subject:

```yaml filename="Expected Relations with caveats"
document:specificdocument#view:
  - "[user:specificuser] is <document:specificdocument#reader>"
  - "[user:caveateduser[...]] might be <document:specificdocument#writer>"
```

<Callout type="info">
  Expected Relations does **not** evaluate caveats, even if the necessary context is fully specified on the relationship.

  This means that a caveated subject that might actually return `HAS_PERMISSION` will appear as `subject[...]` in expected relations
</Callout>
