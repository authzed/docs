# Composable Schemas (Preview)

<Callout type="info">
This preview feature's functionality may change before general release.
</Callout>

In zed version v0.27.0, we introduced a schema compilation command:

```
zed preview schema compile some-schema.zed
```

There are three new pieces of syntax: [import statements](#import-statements), [partial declarations](#partial-declarations), and [partial references](#partial-references).

This is a simple schema that demonstrates all three features:

<Tabs items={["root.zed", "subjects.zed"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>

```zed
import "./subjects.zed"

partial view_partial {
    relation user: user
    permission view = user
}

definition resource {
    ...view_partial

    relation organization: organization
    permission manage = organization
}
```

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>

```zed
definition user {}
definition organization {}
```

</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

Compiling the above with `zed preview schema compile root.zed` will produce an output schema that looks like:

```zed
definition user {}

definition organization {}

definition resource {
    relation user: user
    permission view = user

    relation organization: organization
    permission manage = organization
}
```

This compilation step provides new features that help you modularize your schema, making organization and collaboration easier.

## Import Statements

Import statements allow you to break down a schema along the lines of top-level declarations.

<Tabs items={["root.zed", "one.zed", "two.zed"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>

```zed
// An import keyword followed by a quoted relative filepath
import "./one.zed"

// Note that a bare filename works as a relative path
import "two.zed"

// The imports are included by the compilation process, which means that
// they can be referenced by other definitions
definition resource {
    relation user: user
    relation organization: organization
    
    permission view = user + organization
}
```

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>

```zed
definition user {}
```

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>

```zed
definition organization {}
```

</Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

### Good to Know

* Import references must be within the folder where `zed` is invoked.
* Import cycles are treated as errors.
* All definitions in all imported files are pulled in.
Any duplicate definitions will cause an error.

## Partials

Partial declarations and references provide a means of decomposing a schema along lines that cross definition boundaries.
This can be useful for separating out a schema by team or domain concern, for example.

### Partial Declarations

A partial declaration is a top-level block that is declared using the `partial` keyword.
It can contain relations, permissions, and partial references just like a `definition` block, but its contents
must be referenced by a [partial reference](#partial-references) to show up in the compiled schema.

```zed
partial view_partial {
    ...some_other_partial
    
    relation user: user
    permission view = user
}
```

#### Good to Know

* Any partial that isn't referenced is ignored by the compilation process.
* Partial declarations can contain partial references, allowing for partials to be composed.

### Partial References

A partial reference takes a `partial` and includes the relations and permissions defined in that partial.
It works similarly to [JS spread syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax)
or [python's dictionary unpacking](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#dictionary-displays).

This syntax:

```zed
partial view_partial {
    relation user: user
    permission view = user
}

definition resource {
    ...view_partial
}
```

is equivalent to this declaration:

```zed
definition resource {
    relation user: user
    permission view = user
}
```

#### Good to Know

* Duplicate relations and permissions introduced by a partial reference are treated as errors.
* Circular references between partials are treated as errors.
* You can only reference partial declarations.
Attempting to reference other declaration types (e.g. a definition or a caveat) with a partial reference will result in a error.

## An Example Workflow

1. Make a change to your multi-file schema
1. Run `zed validate` to ensure that the changes are valid
1. Make a PR to your schema repository
1. CI runs `zed validate` again

Then on merge:

1. CI runs `zed preview schema compile`
1. CI calls SpiceDB with the compiled schema

## Notes

SpiceDB `WriteSchema` calls cannot interpret `import` or `partial` syntax.
If using the new syntax, you must build the schema using `compile` before it can be submitted.
This is because a schema write must happen in a single call to SpiceDB.
