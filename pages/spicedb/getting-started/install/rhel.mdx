# Installing SpiceDB on RHEL or CentOS

This document outlines how to install SpiceDB for systems running [RPM-based Linux distributions][rpm].

Every release of SpiceDB publishes `.rpm` packages and tarballs for AMD64 and ARM64 Linux.

Looking for `.deb` packages?
Visit the doc on [Installing SpiceDB on Ubuntu/Debian][deb]

[deb]: ./debian

## Installing SpiceDB using dnf

Before installing SpiceDB, you must first add the source for official SpiceDB RPM builds:

```sh
sudo cat << EOF >> /etc/yum.repos.d/authzed.repo
[authzed]
name=AuthZed Fury Repository
baseurl=https://pkg.authzed.com/yum/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
EOF
```

You can now install SpiceDB and zed, the official command-line tool as normal:

```sh
sudo dnf install -y spicedb zed
```

## Manually installing SpiceDB binary for Linux

Manual installations of SpiceDB for macOS can use the following command to download the latest release for their platform and architecture:

```sh
curl https://api.github.com/repos/authzed/spicedb/releases | \
jq --arg platform $(uname | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]') --arg arch $(uname -m) '.[0].assets.[] | select (.name | contains($platform+"_"+$arch)) | .browser_download_url' -r | \
xargs curl -LO
```

Afterwards, it is up to the user to extract the archive and decide where to place its contents on their systems.

We recommend following the [XDG Base Directory Specification][xdg] if you're not trying to install SpiceDB system-wide.
