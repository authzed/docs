# Installing SpiceDB on Ubuntu or Debian

This document outlines how to install SpiceDB for systems running [Debian-like Linux distributions][debianlike].

Every release of SpiceDB publishes `.deb` packages, [snap] packages, and tarballs for AMD64 and ARM64 Linux.

Looking for `.rpm` packages?
Visit the doc on [Installing SpiceDB on RHEL/Centos][rhel]

[rhel]: ./rhel
[snap]: https://snapcraft.io/spicedb

## Installing SpiceDB using apt-get

Before installing SpiceDB, you must first install the following dependencies:

```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y curl ca-certificates gpg
```

These dependencies are used to verify and trust the official SpiceDB Debian repository.
We'll do that by running the following commands:

```sh
curl https://pkg.authzed.com/apt/gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb https://pkg.authzed.com/apt/ * *" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/authzed.list'
sudo apt update
```

Once the apt has updated with our newly added source for SpiceDB packages, it can be installed just like any other package:

```sh
sudo apt install -y spicedb
```

## Installing SpiceDB using snap

SpiceDB is available in the [Snap Store][snap] making it a single command to install:

```sh
sudo snap install spicedb
```

## Manually installing SpiceDB binary for Linux

Manual installations of SpiceDB can use the following command to download the latest release for their platform and architecture:

```sh
curl https://api.github.com/repos/authzed/spicedb/releases | \
jq --arg platform $(uname | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]') --arg arch $(uname -m) '.[0].assets.[] | select (.name | contains($platform+"_"+$arch)) | .browser_download_url' -r | \
xargs curl -LO
```

Afterwards, it is up to the user to extract the archive and decide where to place its contents on their systems.

We recommend following the [XDG Base Directory Specification][xdg] if you're not trying to install SpiceDB system-wide.
