# Installing SpiceDB on Ubuntu or Debian

This document outlines how to install SpiceDB for systems running [Debian-like Linux distributions][debianlike].

Every release of SpiceDB publishes `.deb` packages, [snap] packages, and tarballs for AMD64 and ARM64 Linux.

Looking for `.rpm` packages?
Visit the doc on [Installing SpiceDB on RHEL/Centos][rhel]

[debianlike]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions#Debian-based
[rhel]: ./rhel
[snap]: https://snapcraft.io/spicedb

## Installing SpiceDB using apt-get

First, download the public signing key for the repository:

```sh
# In releases older than Debian 12 and Ubuntu 22.04, the folder `/etc/apt/keyrings` does not exist by default, and it should be created before the curl command.
# sudo mkdir -p -m 755 /etc/apt/keyrings

curl -sS https://pkg.authzed.com/apt/gpg.key | sudo gpg --dearmor --yes -o /etc/apt/keyrings/authzed.gpg
```

Then add the list file for the repository:

```sh
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/authzed.gpg] https://pkg.authzed.com/apt/ * *"  | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/authzed.list
sudo chmod 644 /etc/apt/sources.list.d/authzed.list  # helps tools such as command-not-found to work correctly
```

Alternatively, if you want to use the new `deb822`-style `authzed.sources` format, put the following in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/authzed.sources`:

```
Types: deb
URIs: https://pkg.authzed.com/apt/
Suites: *
Components: *
Signed-By: /etc/apt/keyrings/authzed.gpg
```

Once you've defined the sources and updated your apt cache, it can be installed just like any other package:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y spicedb
```

## Installing SpiceDB using snap

SpiceDB is available in the [Snap Store][snap] making it a single command to install:

```sh
sudo snap install spicedb
```

## Manually installing SpiceDB binary for Linux

Manual installations of SpiceDB can use the following command to download the latest release for their platform and architecture:

```sh
curl https://api.github.com/repos/authzed/spicedb/releases | \
jq --arg platform $(uname | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]') --arg arch $(uname -m) '.[0].assets.[] | select (.name | contains($platform+"_"+$arch)) | .browser_download_url' -r | \
xargs curl -LO
```

Afterwards, it is up to the user to extract the archive and decide where to place its contents on their systems.

We recommend following the [XDG Base Directory Specification][xdg] if you're not trying to install SpiceDB system-wide.
