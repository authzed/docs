## What is SpiceDB?

SpiceDB is an open-source, [Google Zanzibar]-inspired database system for real-time, security-critical application permissions.

Developers create and apply a [schema] that models their application's resources and permissions.
From their applications, [client libraries] are used to insert [relationships] or check permissions in their applications.

Building modern authorization from scratch is non-trivial and requires years of development from domain experts.
Until SpiceDB, the only developers with access to these workflows were employed by massive tech companies that could invest in building mature, but proprietary solutions.
Now we have a community organized around sharing this technology so the entire industry can benefit.

In some scenarios, SpiceDB can be challenging to operate because it is a critical, low-latency, distributed system.
For folks interested in managed SpiceDB services and enterprise functionality, there are [AuthZed's products][authzed-products].

### A brief SpiceDB history lesson

In August 2020, the founders of AuthZed left [Red Hat], who had acquired their previous company [CoreOS].
In the following month, they would write the first API-complete implementation of Zanzibar; project Arrakis was written in lazily-evaluated, type-annotated Python.
In September, Arrakis was demoed as a part of their [YCombinator] application.
In March 2021, Arrakis was rewritten in Go, a project code named Caladan.
This rewrite would eventually be open-sourced in September 2021 under the name [SpiceDB].

You can also read the [history of Google's Zanzibar project][zanzibar-history], the spiritual predecessor and inspiration for SpiceDB.

### SpiceDB Features

Features that distinguish SpiceDB from other systems include:

- Expressive [gRPC] and [HTTP/JSON] APIs for checking permissions, listing access, and powering devtools
- A distributed, parallel graph engine faithful to the architecture described in [Google's Zanzibar paper]
- A flexible consistency model configurable [per request] that includes resistance to the [New Enemy Problem]
- An expressive [schema language] with a [playground] and CI/CD integrations for [validation] and [integration testing]
- A pluggable [storage system] supporting [in-memory], [Spanner], [CockroachDB], [PostgreSQL] and [MySQL]
- Deep observability with [Prometheus] metrics, [pprof] profiles, structured logging, and [OpenTelemetry] tracing
