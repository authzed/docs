# Official Client Libraries

SpiceDB is primarily accessed by a [gRPC] API and thus client libraries can be generated for any programming language.

AuthZed builds and maintains client libraries for the following languages:

- [Go](https://github.com/authzed/authzed-go)
- [Node](https://github.com/authzed/authzed-node)
- [Python](https://github.com/authzed/authzed-py)
- [Ruby](https://github.com/authzed/authzed-rb)
- [Java](https://github.com/authzed/authzed-java)

AuthZed also develops [zed], a command-line client for interacting with the SpiceDB API.

You can find more languages and integrations maintained by the community in the [Clients section] of the [Awesome SpiceDB] repository.
