# Frequently-asked Questions

## SpiceDB Questions

### Is SpiceDB Open Source?

SpiceDB is developed as an [Apache 2.0-licensed][apache] open-source, community-first effort.

Large contributions must follow a proposal and feedback process regardless of whether the authors are maintainers, AuthZed employees, or brand new to the community.

Other AuthZed open source projects are typically licensed [Apache 2.0][apache] unless they are a fork of another codebase.
Example code is [MIT-licensed][mit] so that they can be modified and adopted into any codebase.

Not all code produced at AuthZed is open source.
There are two conditions under which code is kept proprietary:

- Functionality is minimally applicable to the community and is directly tied to enterprise environments
- Functionality is tied to AuthZed's infrastructure and is not widely applicable to all deployments

### Does SpiceDB secure IT infrastructure?

SpiceDB is a database designed to be integrated into applications.

There are some organizations with homegrown IT use-cases that use SpiceDB.
However, for most IT use cases, this is probably more low-level than what you need.

We recommend looking into tools designed around specific IT workflows such as auditing ([Orca], [PrismaCloud]), goverance, access management ([Indent], [ConductorOne]).

### Is SpiceDB a policy engine?

SpiceDB is not a policy engine.

SpiceDB was inspired by Zanzibar, which popularized the concept of Relationship-based access control (ReBAC).
ReBAC systems offer correctness, performance, and scaling guarantees that are not possible in systems designed purely around policy.
Notably, policy engines cannot implement [Reverse Indices].

However, there are some scenarios where ReBAC systems can benefit from dynamic enforcement.
For these scenarios, SpiceDB supports [Caveats] as a light-weight form of policy that avoids pitfalls present in many other systems.

### How can I get involved with SpiceDB?

The best first step is to join [Discord].

Discord is a great place to chat with other community members and the maintainers of the software.

If you're looking to contribute code, you can read [CONTRIBUTING.md] in our open source projects for details how to contribute, good first issues, and common development workflows.

## Zanzibar Questions

### What is a Reverse Index?

>Reverse-index expand answers the question "what does this employee have access to?", which most organizations validate as part of meeting those compliance obligations.
>But, even more critically, organizations use this information to debug access issues and as baseline data to ensure careful data handling.
>
> — Lea Kissner, Zanzibar Coauthor

In SpiceDB, reverse indices often refer to the [LookupResources] and [LookupSubjects] APIs which are designed to answer the following questions, respectively:

- "What are all of the resources this subject can access?"
- "What are all of the subjects with access to this resource?"

[LookupResources]: https://buf.build/authzed/api/docs/main:authzed.api.v1#authzed.api.v1.PermissionsService.LookupResources
[LookupSubjects]: https://buf.build/authzed/api/docs/main:authzed.api.v1#authzed.api.v1.PermissionsService.LookupSubjects

### How does SpiceDB improve on Google's Zanzibar?

At a high-level, SpiceDB attempts to remain true to Zanzibar's design principles, but without any assumptions around Google's internal infrastructure and use cases.
As a result, many things in SpiceDB are more flexible to accomodate different kinds of users with different software stacks.
For example, [modeling complex user systems][model-users] is possible in SpiceDB, but in Zanzibar all users must be a uint64 identifier.

Because SpiceDB is not forced on developers as company-wide requirement, the project also values developer experience and making the tooling pleasant to work with.
You can see this in our [Schema Language] and [Playground] which vastly improves the user experience of directly manipulating Protocol Buffers at Google.

For more specific details, see the documentation on the [Zanzibar][z-diff].
