# Frequently-asked Questions

## Is SpiceDB Open Source?

SpiceDB is developed as an [Apache 2.0-licensed][apache] open-source, community-first effort.

Large contributions must follow a proposal and feedback process regardless of whether the authors are maintainers, AuthZed employees, or brand new to the community.

Other AuthZed open source projects are typically licensed [Apache 2.0][apache] unless they are a fork of another codebase.
Example code is [MIT-licensed][mit] so that they can be modified and adopted into any codebase.

Not all code produced at AuthZed is open source.
There are two conditions under which code is kept proprietary:

- Functionality is minimally applicable to the community and is directly tied to enterprise environments
- Functionality is tied to AuthZed's infrastructure and is not widely applicable to all deployments

## Does SpiceDB secure IT infrastructure?

SpiceDB is a database designed to be integrated into applications.

There are some organizations with homegrown IT use-cases that use SpiceDB.
However, for most IT use cases, this is probably more low-level than what you need.

We recommend looking into tools designed around specific IT workflows such as auditing ([Orca], [PrismaCloud]), governance, access management ([Indent], [ConductorOne]).

## Is SpiceDB a policy engine?

SpiceDB is not a policy engine.

SpiceDB was inspired by Zanzibar, which popularized the concept of Relationship-based access control (ReBAC).
ReBAC systems offer correctness, performance, and scaling guarantees that are not possible in systems designed purely around policy.
Notably, policy engines cannot implement [Reverse Indices].

However, there are some scenarios where ReBAC systems can benefit from dynamic enforcement.
For these scenarios, SpiceDB supports [Caveats] as a light-weight form of policy that avoids pitfalls present in many other systems.

## How can I get involved with SpiceDB?

The best first step is to join [Discord].

Discord is a great place to chat with other community members and the maintainers of the software.

If you're looking to contribute code, you can read [CONTRIBUTING.md] in our open source projects for details how to contribute, good first issues, and common development workflows.
