# Deploying the SpiceDB Operator

The [SpiceDB Operator] is the best way to run SpiceDB in production.

This guide will walk you through the steps to deploy the SpiceDB Operator to a [Kubernetes] cluster and confirm it's functional by creating a simple SpiceDB deployment.

[SpiceDB Operator]: ../concepts/operator
[Kubernetes]: https://kubernetes.io

## Steps

<Steps>

### Create or Configure a Kubernetes Cluster

The rest of this guide assumes [kubectl] is configured to use an available Kubernetes cluster.

For production use-cases, we recommend using your cloud provider's managed Kubernetes services (e.g. [EKS], [GKE], or [AKS]).

If you want to run a Kubernetes cluster locally, we recommend one of:

- [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io)
- [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io)

[kubectl]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl
[EKS]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/what-is-eks.html
[GKE]: https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/
[AKS]: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/

### Applying the Operator manifests

Before modifying any cluster, we recommend double-checking that your current context is configured for the target cluster:

```sh
kubectl config current-context
```

Now you're ready to apply the manifests that install the SpiceDB Operator:

```sh
kubectl apply --server-side -k github.com/authzed/spicedb-operator/config
```

All resources are created in the `spicedb-operator` namespace.

If you'd like to confirm that the deployment is running, you can run the following command:

```sh
kubectl -n spicedb-operator get pods
```

### Create a SpiceDBCluster

You can now create and configure SpiceDB clusters by applying `SpiceDBCluster` resources.

<Callout type="warning">
  The following manifests configure a simple deployment, not a secure one.

  Do not use these values in production.
</Callout>

Apply a SpiceDBCluster and required [Secret] using the following command:

```sh
kubectl apply --server-side -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: authzed.com/v1alpha1
kind: SpiceDBCluster
metadata:
  name: dev
spec:
  config:
    datastoreEngine: memory
  secretName: dev-spicedb-config
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: dev-spicedb-config
stringData:
  preshared_key: "averysecretpresharedkey"
EOF
```

[secret]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/

### Connect & Verify

In order to verify our SpiceDB deployment is healthy, we're going to need access to ports where it's serving traffic.

The easiest way is to forward the port using kubectl:

```sh
kubectl port-forward deployment/dev-spicedb 50051:50051
```

There are a variety of ways to interact with the SpiceDB API, but for this guide we'll be using the official command-line client, [Zed].

If you don't already have zed installed, you can follow [this guide][install-zed].

For zed to connect to SpiceDB, we'll first have to create an insecure context named `local` for connecting to our locally forwarded port:

```sh
zed context set local localhost:50051 "somerandomkeyhere" --insecure
```

With our context set, we're free to make requests to our new, empty SpiceDB deployment:

```sh
zed schema read
```

If all is successful, reading the schema should have thrown an error:

```
code = NotFound
desc = No schema has been defined; please call WriteSchema to start
```

### Taking things to production

This guide creates a single-node deployment of SpiceDB with no persistent storage; to really take things into production, it's just a matter of configuration.

To learn more about configuring the SpiceDB Operator, you can reference the [SpiceDB Operator docs][SpiceDB Operator] or reference the [community examples GitHub repository][examples] which has more deployment examples including TLS, connecting to datastore backends, and configuring ingress.
