# Reflection APIs

The [Reflection APIs] in SpiceDB (starting at version v1.33.0) provide the ability to reflect on the stored schema
and type information to answer questions about the schema itself, as well as its permissions and
relations.

[Reflection APIs]: https://buf.build/authzed/api/docs/main:authzed.api.v1#authzed.api.v1.SchemaService.ReflectSchema

## ReflectSchema

`ReflectSchema` provides an API-driven means of receiving the structure of the current
schema stored in SpiceDB.

It is designed primarily to allow callers to make dynamic decisions based on the structure of the
schema, such as being able to see all the permissions defined for a particular type of resource.

```proto
ReflectSchemaRequest{}

ReflectSchemaResponse{
  Definitions: []{
     { Name: "user" },
     {
        Name: "organization",
        Relations: []{
           { Name: "member", SubjectTypes: []{ { Name: "user" } }, ... },
        },
     },
     {
       Name: "resource",
       Comment: "// resource is some kind of resource",
       Relations: []{ ... },
       Permissions: []{ ... },
     },
  },
}
```

### Filtering

`ReflectSchemaRequest` also includes support for filters which can be used to filter
the response to a specific subset of the schema:

```proto
ReflectSchemaRequest{
  OptionalFilters: []{
     {
        OptionalDefinitionNameFilter: "a" // filter to defs starting with `a`
     },
  },
}
```

## DiffSchema

`DiffSchema` provides an API-driven means of comparing the currently stored schema
in SpiceDB to another schema.

This API is useful for tooling such as CI/CD that needs to determine what changes, if any,
exist between the current schema and a future schema.

```proto
DiffSchema{
  ComparisonSchema: """
    definition user  {}

    // an added comment
    definition organization {
      relation member: user
    }

    // resource is some kind of resource
    definition resource {
      relation viewer: user
      relation editor: user

      relation org: organization

      permission edit = editor
      permission view = viewer + editor + org->member
    }
  """
}

ReflectSchemaResponse{
  Diffs: []{
    { DefinitionDocCommentChanged: { Name: "organization", ... } },
    { PermissionExprChanged: { Name: "view", ... } },
  }
}
```

## DependentRelations

`DependentRelations` is a reflection API that provides the list of relations and
permissions that are used to compute a particular permission.

```proto
DependentRelationsRequest{
  DefinitionName: "resource"
  PermissionName: "view"
}

DependentRelationsResponse{
  Relations: []{
     { DefinitionName: "organization", RelationName: "member", IsPermission: false},
     { DefinitionName: "resource", RelationName: "org", IsPermission: false},
     { DefinitionName: "resource", RelationName: "viewer", IsPermission: false},
     { DefinitionName: "resource", RelationName: "edit", IsPermission: true},
     { DefinitionName: "resource", RelationName: "editor", IsPermission: false},
  }
}
```

## ComputablePermissions

`ComputablePermissions` is the inverse of `DependentRelations`: it helps
to determine any permissions impacted by a change to a relation or permission.

```proto
ComputablePermissionsRequest{
  DefinitionName: "resource"
  RelationName: "viewer"
}

ComputablePermissionsResponse{
  Permissions: []{
    { DefinitionName: "resource", RelationName: "view", IsPermission: true},
  }
}
```
