# Frequently-asked Questions

## Is SpiceDB Open Source?

SpiceDB is developed as an [Apache 2.0-licensed][apache] open-source, community-first effort.

Large contributions must follow a proposal and feedback process regardless of whether the authors are maintainers, AuthZed employees, or brand new to the community.

Other AuthZed open source projects are typically licensed [Apache 2.0][apache] unless they are a fork of another codebase.
Example code is [MIT-licensed][mit] so that they can be modified and adopted into any codebase.

Not all code produced at AuthZed is open source.
There are two conditions under which code is kept proprietary:

- Functionality is minimally applicable to the community and is directly tied to enterprise environments
- Functionality is tied to AuthZed's infrastructure and is not widely applicable to all deployments

## Does SpiceDB secure IT infrastructure?

SpiceDB is a database designed to be integrated into applications.

There are some organizations with homegrown IT use-cases that use SpiceDB.
However, for most IT use cases, this is probably more low-level than what you need.

We recommend looking into tools designed around specific IT workflows such as auditing ([Orca], [PrismaCloud]), governance, access management ([Indent], [ConductorOne]).

## Is SpiceDB a policy engine?

SpiceDB is not a policy engine.

SpiceDB was inspired by Zanzibar, which popularized the concept of Relationship-based access control (ReBAC).
ReBAC systems offer correctness, performance, and scaling guarantees that are not possible in systems designed purely around policy.
Notably, policy engines cannot implement [Reverse Indices].

However, there are some scenarios where ReBAC systems can benefit from dynamic enforcement.
For these scenarios, SpiceDB supports [Caveats] as a light-weight form of policy that avoids pitfalls present in many other systems.

## How do I filter resources based on access decisions in SpiceDB?

There are three approaches for filtering resources based on whether users have access to them:

1. **LookupResources** - Use when the number of accessible resources is relatively small. Call `LookupResources` to get all resource IDs the user can access, then use those IDs as a filter in your database query (e.g., `WHERE id = ANY(ARRAY[...])`). This is the simplest approach and a good starting point.

2. **CheckBulkPermissions** - Use when accessible resources are too large for LookupResources. Fetch a page of candidate results from your database, then call `CheckBulkPermissions` to determine which ones the user can access. Keep iterating until you have a full page of permitted results. This works well with cursor-based pagination and search interfaces.

3. **Materialize** (Early Access) - For maximum scalability with large datasets or high traffic. Materialize watches permission changes in SpiceDB and maintains a local denormalized view of user permissions, allowing you to use simple database JOINs for filtering.

Choose based on your scale: start with LookupResources, move to CheckBulkPermissions when needed, and consider Materialize for the highest performance requirements. [Learn more]

## How do I get all of the permissions a subject has on a resource?

There isn't an API that answers this question directly. Instead, you should use the
[`CheckBulkPermissions`](https://buf.build/authzed/api/docs/main:authzed.api.v1#authzed.api.v1.PermissionsService.CheckBulkPermissions) API and send a check for each of the permissions you want to check.

It means that you'll need to update your permission checks when you add a new permission, but you'd need to update the calling code
to handle the concept that a new permission represents anyway.

## How can I get involved with SpiceDB?
