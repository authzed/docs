# Attributes

If you are migrating to SpiceDB from a pre-existing authorization system, it's likely that attributes play a part in your authorization evaluations.

SpiceDB is a Relationship Based Access control system.
This gives SpiceDB the flexibility to evaluate attributes for access control alongside more complicated access control logic like roles and/or relationships.

The sections below will provide practical examples for implementing various kinds of attributes in the SpiceDB schema language.
Before reading this guide, it's recommended that you have some familiarity with the SpiceDB schema language.
[These documents](/spicedb/modeling/developing-a-schema) are a good place to start.

## Boolean Attributes

A boolean attribute is an attribute on an object that affects authorization by enabling or disabling an authorization setting.
Boolean attributes can often be thought of as a toggle.
Feature flag authorization can be enabled with boolean attributes.

### Loop Relationships

Loop relationships are another way to implement boolean attributes.

Loop relationships relate an object to itself.
A loop relationship is walked with an [arrow](/spicedb/concepts/schema#--arrow) back to an object's self.
In practice, relating something to itself toggles something on.

In the example below, there is a schema that enforces the following authorization logic: a user can
only view a document if the user is related to the document as viewer and editing is enabled for the
document (this is the same authorization logic used in the wildcard example above).

In the example below, to enable editing for a document, a self relationship using the `edit_enabled` relation must be written.
When a `document` is related to itself with the `edit_enabled` relation, that relation can be walked to itself
(with the arrow) to determine who relates to the document as an `editor`.

In summary, a `user` has permission to edit a `document` if they are related to that document as an `editor`
and that document is related to itself with `edit_enabled`.

<Callout type="warning">
  There is no mechanism in the SpiceDB schema language that enforces that a
  relation be used as a self relation. In order to avoid accidentally misusing a
  self relation (e.g. relating an object to a different instance of the same
  type) it is recommended to implement client side logic that enforces only
  using the self relation for it's intended purpose.
</Callout>

### Wildcards

[Wildcards](/spicedb/concepts/schema#wildcards) are a way to implement boolean attributes.
Wildcards modify a type so that a relationship can be written to all objects of a resource type but not individual objects.

In the example below, the schema enforces the following authorization logic: a user will have `edit` permission on the document if they are related to the document as an `editor` and they relate to the document through `edit_enabled`.
Both are required because `editor` and `edit_enabled` are [intersected](/spicedb/concepts/schema#-intersection) at the `edit` permission definition.
To enable document editing, you need to establish a relationship that connects all users to the document using the `edit_enabled` relation: `document:somedocument#edit_enabled@user:*`.

<InlinePlayground reference="p6ltnJZ2Zso7" />

<Callout type="info">
  Wildcards are adequate for most binary attribute scenarios; however, wildcards
  are not currently supported by [Authzed
  Materialize](/authzed/concepts/authzed-materialize). Those who plan to use
  Materialize should use self relationships for binary attributes.

## Attribute Matching

For this guide, attribute matching is defined as scenarios where a user or group of users needs to have an attribute (or set of attributes) required by a resource in order to perform a specific action on the resource.

### Match at Least One Attribute of a Single Type

Attribute matching can be achieved by relating a user to an attribute as a "member" and relating a resource to its required attribute objects.

In the example below, users must match **at least one** of the document's country attributes in order to view the document.

Country attributes are represented by the `country` object definition and every user that has a specific country attribute is related to the specific country.
When a `document` has a country attribute that can grant `edit` permission for a user, it is related to that country.

<InlinePlayground reference="RAl67nbN8HXr" />

### Match all Attributes of a Single Type

It's possible to specify that **_all_** attributes must be satisfied by using an [intersection arrow](/spicedb/concepts/schema#all-intersection-arrow).

In the example below, users must match **all** of the document's `country` attributes in order to view the document.

This example is similar to the one above, except it requires that all attributes are satisfied instead of at least one attribute.

<InlinePlayground reference="XlzC7_cVWrxh" />

### Match at Least One Attribute from Each Type of Attribute

When you have several types of attributes, it's recommended that you have an object definition for each type of attribute and that you use [subject relations](/spicedb/concepts/schema#subject-relations) to connect resources to the required attribute.

<InlinePlayground reference="oBZyiY66Y81J" />

### Match All Attributes from Each Type of Attribute

It's possible to specify that **_all_** attributes must be satisfied by using an [intersection arrow](/spicedb/concepts/schema#all-intersection-arrow).

In the example below, users must match **all** of the document's `country` and `status` attributes in order to view the document.

This example is similar to the one above, except it requires that all `country` and `status` attributes are satisfied instead of at least one attribute of each type.

## Caveats

In almost all cases, [caveats](/spicedb/concepts/caveats) should only be used when data required to evaluate a CheckPermission request is only available at the time of the request (e.g. user's current location or time of day).
Using caveats for static data (e.g. a document's status) can have negative performance impacts.
Static attribute data should always be modeled in the schema using patterns similar to those described above.
