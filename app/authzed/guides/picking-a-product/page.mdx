### Open Source

We understand that AuthZed's product suite will not satisfy all use cases and, for that reason, we've built and continue to invest in an open-source community around SpiceDB.

Community support is available to absolutely everyone and does not require any form of payment or usage of AuthZed products.

[Discord] is the first line of support for asking questions or getting help with SpiceDB in real time.
[GitHub Discussions] is also available for asynchronous questions.
For bug reports, feature requests, and development discussion, [GitHub Issues] are available to all for participation.

<Callout type="info">
  The community encompasses not only folks paid to contribute, but maintainers and end-users volunteering their time to answer your questions.

Please be respectful and read over the community [Code of Conduct] before interacting.
