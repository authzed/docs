## What is included in SpiceDB Dedicated?

SpiceDB Dedicated delivers raw compute where users choose how they want to provision SpiceDB clusters of varying sizes.

Compute is purchasable in buckets that equate to what can operate a normalized SpiceDB cluster at 600 permission checks per second.
Each bucket can only be allocated to one cloud region.

SpiceDB Dedicated is backed by our Uptime SLA, and monitored 24/7 by an on-call engineer. Customer's can leverage our Support Desk or Slack to submit support tickets.

## How is SpiceDB Dedicated isolated?

Compute is isolated to its own cloud provider subaccount.
All resources are allocated into a VPC and peered only with the user's own VPC and the systems used to provision and manage these resources.
