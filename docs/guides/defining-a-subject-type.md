# Defining a Subject Type

Within a Permissions System, a [CheckPermission] call is always made between an object representing the *resource* and an object representing a *subject*: The API call returns whether the *subject* has the specified permission on the *resource*.

[CheckPermission]: https://buf.build/authzed/api/docs/main:authzed.api.v1#CheckPermission

The choice of how to represent subjects can have large downstream effects on the design of a permissions system.

## Representing users as subjects

The most common kind of subjects found within a permissions system are some form of **user**.

Users in SpiceDB/Authzed are [modeled as object types], same as resources.

[modeled as object types]: https://authzed.com/blog/why-model-users/

Typically, it is users that are accessing your application or service and, therefore, it is for them that the various permissions must be checked.

Choosing how to represent a user as a subject in Authzed/SpiceDB is very important, as the wrong choice can cause permissions checks to be incomplete or, in some cases, wrong.

### Using a *stable* external identifier

The most common and recommended approach for representing a user as a subject is to use a **stable** identifier for the user as the subject's object ID.

For example, if the authentication system used is OIDC and provides a `sub` field, then the object IDs for the users might be the `sub` field:

```
check resource:someresource view user:goog|487306745603273
```

As the `sub` field is **guaranteed** to be stable for that particular user (if a compliant OIDC implementation), it is safe to use for checking permissions, as there is no risk that the `sub` will somehow represent a different user later.

:::note
If you have *multiple* authentication provides, then the recommendation is to define a subject type for *each* provider, to ensure a clean namespace:

```zed
/** githubuser represents a user from GitHub */
definition githubuser {}

/** gitlabuser represents a user from Gitlab */
definition gitlabuser {}
```

:::

### Using a primary key

The second most common approach is to have a representation of the subject in another backing data store, typically a relational database.

If such a database exists, and there exists a single row per user, then using the row's primary ID (typically an integer or a UUID) represents another safe ID to use for user:

```
check resource:someresource view user:1337
```

:::warning
If using an auto-generated or auto-incrementing integer, make sure it cannot be reused.
Some databases allow various sequences to reuse IDs.

### What about e-mail addresses?

:::warning
It is typically **not recommended** to use an e-mail address to represent a user as as a subject in Authzed/SpiceDB.
:::

This is for a number of reasons:

- E-mail addresses are not universally stable and, often times, services allow them to be reused
- E-mail addresses are not universally verified and, often times, a caller of the [CheckPermission] may not be *certain* that the user has that e-mail address
- Authzed/SpiceDB does not allow for `@` characters within object IDs

If you know for **certain** that the e-mail address for a user is both stable and verified, and still wish to use it as the subject ID, then we recommend base64 encoding (with padding removed) the e-mail address to use it within Authzed/SpiceDB.

## Representing anonymous visitors as subjects

Some applications allow for *anonymous* access to view (and occasionally, edit) various resources.

Representing an anonymous visitor in Authzed/SpiceDB can be done via simply defining another subject type to represent the unauthenticated users:

```zed
/** user represents a specific authenticated user */
definition user {}

/** anonymoususer represents an unauthenticated user */
definition anonymoususer {}
```

To grant access to anonymous users to a resource, either a single **static** object ID can be used to represent *all* anonymous users (such as `all`) or [wildcards] can be used:

```zed title="document with anonymous user wildcard allowed"
definition document {
  relation reader: user | anonymoususer:*
}
```

[wildcards]: /reference/schema-lang#wildcards

:::note
It is recommended to use *wildcard* with an anonymous user definition if there is ever a need to differentiate between anonymous users based on their object IDs.

As an example, an anonymous user of a commenting system might be assigned a unique ID that is stored in their browser's cookies, enabling permission for editing a previously posted comment.
:::

## Representing services as subjects

If your permissions checks are between machines or services and other services, it is recommended that the subject type be a representation of that service or its means of providing its identity.

For example, you might represent a service directly:

```zed
definition service {}

definition resource {
    relation viewer: service
}
```

Or via a token it was granted:

```zed
definition token {}

definition service {
    token: token
}

definition resource {
    relation viewer: service#token
}
```
