# Installing SpiceDB on macOS

This document outlines how to install SpiceDB for systems running Apple's macOS.

Every release of SpiceDB publishes for both Intel (AMD64) and M-series (ARM64) versions of macOS.

## Installing SpiceDB using Homebrew

The quickest way to get started with SpiceDB on macOS is to use Homebrew.
This will install both zed, the command-line tool, and the SpiceDB server binary.

```sh
brew install authzed/tap/spicedb authzed/tap/zed
```

## Updating SpiceDB using Homebrew

SpiceDB will log a warning if you are running an out-of-date version.
To ensure that you are using the latest stable release, you can run the following command to upgrade an existing installation of SpiceDB:

```sh
brew upgrade authzed/tap/spicedb
```

## Manually installing SpiceDB binary for macOS

Manual installations of SpiceDB for macOS can use the following command to download the latest release for their platform and architecture:

```sh
curl https://api.github.com/repos/authzed/spicedb/releases | \
jq --arg platform $(uname | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]') --arg arch $(uname -m) '.[0].assets.[] | select (.name | contains($platform+"_"+$arch)) | .browser_download_url' -r | \
xargs curl -LO
```

Afterwards, it is up to the user to extract the archive and decide where to place its contents on their systems.

We recommend following the [XDG Base Directory Specification][xdg] if you're not trying to install SpiceDB system-wide.
