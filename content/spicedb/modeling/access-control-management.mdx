# Access-Control Management

It's common to build applications with an access control management interface that lets privileged users visualize and modify permissions assigned to other users.
Depending on the permission model you've chosen for your application, several APIs in SpiceDB will help you to implement the feature.

Let's describe some of the most common patterns.

## Resource-Specific Access-Control Management

When creating a UI to manage user access-control privileges over a resource, there are various potential features one may want to implement:

- listing all users assigned with their role
- listing all the fine-grained permissions a user may have assigned

### Coarse-Grained Access Control

Let's say we have a traditional coarse-grained access control model where you assign roles to users over a resource, like GitHub's Role-Based Access Control model, and you want to list each one of the users and teams assigned alongside the role.
These role assignments are typically implemented as a relation between the target resource and the subject.

```zed
definition user {}

definition team {
  relation member: user
}

definition repository {
  relation role_reader: user | team#member
  relation role_writer: user | team#member
  relation role_adminer: user | team#member

  permission read = role_reader + write
  permission write = role_writer + admin
  permission admin = role_adminer

}
```

If you wanted to implement an access-control management UI for this model, you could use the [ReadRelationships] API.
When the set of roles is limited, you can do a call per role:

```shell zed
zed relationship read repository:kubernetes role_reader
zed relationship read repository:kubernetes role_writer
zed relationship read repository:kubernetes role_adminer
```

If instead, you didn't want to hard-code each role in your application you could first determine the available relations, and then read the associated relationships:

1. List all relations on the definition using [ExperimentalReflectSchema], which will let you query information about the schema, with the [Schema Filter] set to `optional_definition_name_filter=repository` and `optional_relation_name_filter=role_`.
1. Issue a `ReadRelationship` request for each role returned from the API call above

### Fine-Grained Access Control

Now let's imagine that instead, we have a fine-grained access control model.
Typically you see these implemented as "Custom Roles".
It's still a Role-Based Access Control Model, but one that lets you define the individual permissions associated with each Role.
This model is not different from the previous one in which users are still assigned roles over the resource, but these roles are fully customizable, instead of pre-canned.

```zed

definition user{}

definition repository {
  relation grants: role_grant

  permission create_issue = grants->create_issue
}

definition role_grant {
  relation role: role
  relation grantee: user | team#user

  permission create_issue = role->create_issue & grantee
  permission delete_issue = role->delete_issue & grantee
}

definition role {
  relation create_issue: user:*
  relation delete_issue: user:*
}
```

You can follow a similar strategy if you want to show the roles:

```shell zed
# returns the role grants over the kubernetes repository
zed relationship read repository:kubernetes grants
```

This will let you list each user and team with the assigned role name.
But what if you wanted instead to list the individual permissions, rather than the role?

You could issue a `ReadRelationship` to determine the `role` of the grant, and a subsequent one with `role:my_role` as the resource and list all the relationships.
The resource relation of each list item represents all fine-grained permissions for the role.

```shell zed
# returns the role of the grant
zed relationship read role_grant:my_role_grant role
# returns the fine-grained permissions of the role
zed relationship read role:my_role
```
