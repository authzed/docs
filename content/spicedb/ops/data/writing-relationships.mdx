# Writing relationships

This page will provide some practical recommendations for writing relationships to SpiceDB.
If you are interested in relationships as a concept, check out this [page](/spicedb/concepts/relationships).

## Retries

When making requests to SpiceDB, it's important to implement proper retry logic to handle transient failures. [SpiceDB APIs use gRPC\*](/spicedb/getting-started/client-libraries), which can experience various types of temporary failures that can be resolved through retries.

Retries are recommended for all gRPC methods, not just WriteRelationships.

\*SpiceDB can also expose an [HTTP API](/spicedb/getting-started/client-libraries#http-clients); however, gRPC is recommended.

### Implementing Retry Policies

You can implement your own retry policies using the gRPC Service Config.
Below, you will find a recommended Retry Policy.

```
"retryPolicy": {
  "maxAttempts": 3,
  "initialBackoff": "1s",
  "maxBackoff": "4s",
  "backoffMultiplier": 2,
  "retryableStatusCodes": [
    'UNAVAILABLE', 'RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED', 'DEADLINE_EXCEEDED', 'ABORTED',
  ]
}
```

This retry policy configuration provides exponential backoff with the following behavior:

**`maxAttempts: 3`** - Allows for a maximum of 3 total attempts (1 initial request + 2 retries).
This prevents infinite retry loops while giving sufficient opportunity for transient issues to resolve.

**`initialBackoff: "1s"`** - Sets the initial delay to 1 second before the first retry attempt.
This gives the system time to recover from temporary issues.

**`maxBackoff: "4s"`** - Caps the maximum delay between retries at 4 seconds to prevent excessively long waits that could impact user experience.

**`backoffMultiplier: 2`** - Doubles the backoff time with each retry attempt.
Combined with the other settings, this creates a retry pattern of: 1s → 2s → 4s.

**`retryableStatusCodes`** - Only retries on specific gRPC status codes that indicate transient failures: -`UNAVAILABLE`: SpiceDB is temporarily unavailable -`RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`: SpiceDB is overloaded -`DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`: Request timed out -`ABORTED`: Operation was aborted, often due to conflicts that may resolve on retry

You can find a python retry example [here](https://github.com/authzed/examples/blob/main/data/retry/main.py).

## Writes: Touch vs Create

A SpiceDB [relationship update](https://buf.build/authzed/api/docs/main:authzed.api.v1#authzed.api.v1.RelationshipUpdate) can use one of three operation types `CREATE`, `TOUCH`, OR `DELETE`.
This section will cover `CREATE` and `TOUCH`.
You can read more about `DELETE` in [the section below](#deleting-relationships).

### Understanding the Operations

**`CREATE`** - Inserts a new relationship.
If the relationship already exists, the operation will fail with an error.

**`TOUCH`** - Upserts a relationship.
If the relationship already exists, it will do nothing.
If it doesn't exist, it will create it.

### Key Differences

| Operation | Behavior on Existing Relationship | Performance              | Use Case                      |
| --------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| `CREATE`  | Fails with error                  | Faster (single insert)   | Initial relationship creation |
| `TOUCH`   | Updates/overwrites                | Slower (delete + insert) | Idempotent operations         |

### Special Considerations

**Expiring Relationships:** When working with [expiring relationships](/spicedb/concepts/expiring-relationships), always use `TOUCH`.
If a relationship has expired but hasn't been garbage collected yet, using `CREATE` will return an error.

**Error Handling:** When using `CREATE`, be prepared to handle duplicate relationship errors appropriately in your application logic.

## Deleting Relationships

SpiceDB provides two methods for deleting relationships: using the `WriteRelationships` API with the `DELETE` operation or using the `DeleteRelationships` API.
Each approach has different behaviors and use cases.

### WriteRelationships with the `DELETE` Operation

The [`WriteRelationships`](https://buf.build/authzed/api/docs/main:authzed.api.v1#authzed.api.v1.WriteRelationshipsRequest) API supports a `DELETE` operation type that allows you to remove specific relationships as part of a batch of relationship updates.

**`DELETE`** - Removes a relationship.
If the relationship does not exist, the operation will silently succeed (no-op).

#### Characteristics

- **Atomic Operations**: Can be combined with other relationship operations (`CREATE`, `TOUCH`) in a single atomic transaction
- **Granular Control**: Delete specific relationships alongside creating or updating others
- **Silent Failure**: Does not fail if the relationship doesn't exist
- **Batch Limit**: Subject to the same batch size limits as other `WriteRelationships` operations (1,000 updates by default)

### DeleteRelationships API

The [`DeleteRelationships`](https://buf.build/authzed/api/docs/main:authzed.api.v1#authzed.api.v1.DeleteRelationshipsRequest) API is a dedicated method for bulk deletion of relationships based on filters rather than specifying individual relationships.

#### Characteristics

- **Filter-Based**: Delete relationships based on resource type, relation, subject type, or combinations thereof
- **Bulk Operations**: Can delete many relationships matching the filter criteria in a single call
- **Separate Transaction**: Operates independently from `WriteRelationships`
- **Efficient for Mass Deletion**: Optimized for removing large numbers of relationships
